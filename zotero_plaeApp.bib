	abstract = {High acuity vision in primates, including humans, is mediated by a small central retinal region called the fovea. As more accessible model organisms lack a fovea, its specialized function and dysfunction in ocular diseases remain poorly understood. We used 165,000 single-cell RNA-seq profiles to generate and validate comprehensive cellular taxonomies of macaque fovea and peripheral retina. More than 80\% of {\textgreater}65 cell types match between the two regions, but exhibit substantial differences in proportions and gene expression, some of which we relate to functional differences. Comparison of macaque retinal types with those of mice reveals that interneuron types are tightly conserved, but that projection neuron types and programs diverge, despite conserved transcription factor codes. Key macaque types are conserved in humans, allowing mapping of cell-type and region-specific expression of {\textgreater}190 genes associated with 6 human retinal diseases. Our work provides a framework for comparative single-cell analysis across tissue regions and species.},

Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.

	abstract = {Background: The development of highly scalable single-cell transcriptome technology has resulted in the creation of thousands of datasets, \&gt;30 in the retina alone. Analyzing the transcriptomes between different projects is highly desirable because this would allow for better assessment of which biological effects are consistent across independent studies. However it is difficult to compare and contrast data across different projects because there are substantial batch effects from computational processing, single-cell technology utilized, and the natural biological variation. While many single-cell transcriptome-specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise, it is difficult to ascertain which method functions best. Results: We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP, single-cell Pick Optimal Parameters) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and cell type/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile-based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and 3 species to create a massive ocular single-cell transcriptome meta-atlas. Conclusions: This provides a model for how to efficiently create meta-atlases for tissues and cells of interest.},

This technology has enabled researchers to identify expression signatures for rare cell types and characterize how gene expression changes across biological conditions, such as topographic region or disease status. However, sharing single-cell RNA sequencing results remains a major obstacle, particular for individuals without a computational background. To address these limitations, we developed Spectacle, an interactive web-based resource for exploring previously published single-cell RNA sequencing data from ocular studies. Spectacle is powered by a locally developed R package, cellcuratoR, which utilizes the Shiny framework in R to generate interactive visualizations for single-cell expression data. Spectacle contains five pre-processed ocular single-cell RNA sequencing data sets and is accessible via the web at OcularGeneExpression.org/singlecell. With Spectacle, users can interactively identify which cell types express a gene of interest, detect transcriptomic subpopulations within a cell type, and perform highly flexible differential expression analyses. The freely-available Spectacle system reduces the bioinformatic barrier for interacting with rich single-cell RNA sequencing studies from ocular tissues, making it easy to quickly identify cell types that express a gene of interest.},

Analyzing organs from the same individual controls for genetic background, age, environment, and epigenetic effects, and enables a detailed comparison of cell types that are shared between tissues. This resource provides a rich molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and detailed information about tissue specific variation in gene expression. We have used the fact that multiple tissues came from the same donor to study the clonal distribution of T cells between tissues, to understand the tissue specific mutation rate in B cells, and to analyze the cell cycle state and proliferative potential of shared cell types across tissues. Finally, we have also used this data to characterize cell type specific RNA splicing and how such splicing varies across tissues within an individual.

Individual cells from multiple developmental stages were isolated and profiled on Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization on dissociated retinas was used to verify and extend the microarray results by allowing quantitative measurements of a large number of cells coexpressing two genes. Together, these experiments have yielded an expanded view of the processes underway in developing retinal ganglion and amacrine cells, as well as several hundred new marker genes for these cell types.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Molecular analysis of complex phenomena, such as selective death of photoreceptors and their rescue by neuro-protective agents, has been hindered by limitations of techniques for investigating gene expression in individual cells within a heterogeneous tissue such as the retina. The purpose of this study was to develop methods to assess gene expression in single retinal cells.
METHODS: Individual cells from papain-dissociated mouse retinae were captured with micropipettes and identified by morphology and by immunocytochemistry. Single cell cDNA libraries were generated by poly-d(T)-primed reverse transcription, poly-d(A) tailing of first strand cDNA, and en masse PCR-amplification using a custom made oligo-d(T). PCR was used to investigate gene expression in cDNAs from individual cells.
RESULTS: Dissociated rod and Müller glia cells maintained their morphology, which correlated with their immunocytochemical properties. RPE cells were recognized by their pigmentation. With the exception of bipolar cells, non-photoreceptor neurons were only identifiable by immunocytochemistry. Abundant cDNA could be synthesized from each individual cell. Cell-specific "markers" were detected by PCR almost exclusively in the predicted cell types. The expression of neurotrophic factor receptors was consistent with previous biological studies.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish a method to compare, investigate, and analyze gene expression in individual cells of the retina.},

Individuals can have more than one M and/or more than one L pigment gene on the X chromosome along with an S pigment gene on chromosome 7. In some people the X-linked pigment gene array can include polymorphic variants that encode multiple, spectrally distinct cone photopigment subtypes. A single-cell, polymerase chain reaction approach was used to examine visual pigment gene expression in individual human cone cells and identify them as L or M. The ratio of L:M pigment gene expression was assayed in homogenized retinal tissues taken from the same eyes. Results indicate that there is a close correspondence between the cone ratio determined from counting single cells and the L:M pigment mRNA ratio estimated from homogenized pieces of retina. The results also show that the different pigment genes in one array are often expressed at very different levels, giving rise to unequal numbers of L and M cones. Expression of only one photopigment gene was detected in each cone cell. However, individual males can have more than the classically described three spectrally distinct cone types in their retinas.},

We analyzed the isoform pattern and the functional properties of agrin in a defined population of CNS neurons. At all developmental stages retinal ganglion cells purified by immunopanning expressed the agrin B0, B11, and B19 isoforms. Single-cell RT-PCR of individual retinal ganglion cells revealed simultaneous expression of B0 and B11 isoforms in about half of the neurons analyzed. Despite the expression of agrin isoforms active in AChR aggregation, ganglion cells did not aggregate AChRs when cocultured with myotubes. Addition of exogenous agrin to myotube-ganglion cell cocultures indicated that AChR aggregation is inhibited. These results demonstrate that a defined population of CNS neurons can simultaneously express several agrin isoforms and that the AChR aggregation activity of agrin might be regulated not only by alternative splicing but also on the protein level.},

	abstract = {Retinal bipolar neurons serve as relay interneurons that connect rod and cone photoreceptor cells to amacrine and ganglion cells. They exhibit diverse morphologies essential for correct routing of photoreceptor cell signals to specific postsynaptic amacrine and ganglion cells. The development and physiology of these interneurons have not been completely defined molecularly. Despite previous identification of genes expressed in several bipolar cell subtypes, molecules that mark each bipolar cell type still await discovery. In this report, novel genetic markers of murine bipolar cells were found. Candidates were initially generated by using microarray analysis of single bipolar cells and mining of retinal serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. These candidates were subsequently tested for expression in bipolar cells by RNA in situ hybridization. Ten new molecular markers were identified, five of which are highly enriched in their expression in bipolar cells within the adult retina. Double-labeling experiments using probes for previously characterized subsets of bipolar cells were performed to identify the subtypes of bipolar cells that express the novel markers. Additionally, the expression of bipolar cell genes was analyzed in Bhlhb4 knockout retinas, in which rod bipolar cells degenerate postnatally, to delineate further the identity of bipolar cells in which novel markers are found. From the analysis of Bhlhb4 mutant retinas, cone bipolar cell gene expression appears to be relatively unaffected by the degeneration of rod bipolar cells. Identification of molecular markers for the various subtypes of bipolar cells will lead to greater insights into the development and function of these diverse interneurons. J. Comp.

While each of these cells has a specific function contributing to proper vision in the mature animal, their differential representation in the retina as well as the presence of distinctive cellular subtypes makes identifying the transcriptomic signatures that lead to each retinal cell's fate determination and development challenging. We have analyzed transcriptomes from individual cells isolated from the chick retina throughout retinogenesis. While we focused our efforts on the retinal ganglion cells, our transcriptomes of developing chick cells also contained representation from multiple retinal cell types, including photoreceptors and interneurons at different stages of development. Most interesting was the identification of transcriptomes from individual mixed lineage progenitor cells in the chick as these cells offer a window into the cell fate decision-making process. Taken together, these data sets will enable us to uncover the most critical genes acting in the steps of cell fate determination and early differentiation of various retinal cell types.},

Advances in single cell transcriptomic profiling have enabled the identification of molecular signatures for cellular subtypes that are only rarely found. Therefore, we used single cell profiling combined with hierarchical clustering and correlate analyses to identify genes expressed in distinct populations of Parvalbumin-expressing cells and functionally classified RGCs. RGCs were manually isolated based either upon fluorescence or physiological distinction through cell-attached recordings. Microarray hybridization and RNA-Sequencing were employed for the characterization of transcriptomes and in situ hybridization was utilized to further characterize gene candidate expression. Gene candidates were identified based upon cluster correlation, as well as expression specificity within physiologically distinct classes of RGCs. Further, we identified Prph, Ctxn3, and Prkcq as potential candidates for ipRGC classification in the murine retina. The use of these genes, or one of the other newly identified subset markers, for the generation of a transgenic mouse would enable future studies of RGC-subtype specific function, wiring, and projection.},

Results: To examine the molecular underpinnings of this observation, microarray analysis of single retinal cells from wild-type or Notch1 conditional knockout retinas was performed. In situ hybridization was carried out to validate some of the findings. Conclusions: The majority of Notch1-mutant cells lost expression of known Notch target genes. These cells also had low levels of RPC and cell cycle genes, and robustly up-regulated rod precursor genes. In addition, single wild-type cells, in which cell cycle marker genes were down-regulated, expressed markers of both rod photoreceptors and interneurons.

	abstract = {Purpose
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive retinal degeneration in which the retina loses nearly all of its photoreceptor cells and undergoes major structural changes. Little is known regarding the role the resident glia, the Müller glia, play in the progression of the disease. In this article, we define gene expression changes in Müller glial cells (MGCs) from two different mouse models of RP, the retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) and rhodopsin knockout (Rhod-ko) models. The RNA repertoire of single MGCs was comprehensively profiled, and a comparison was made between MGCs from wild-type (WT) and mutant retinas. Two time points were chosen for analysis, one at the peak of rod photoreceptor death and one during the period of cone photoreceptor death.

Methods
Retinas were dissociated, and single MGCs were chosen under a dissecting microscope using a micropipette. Single cell cDNAs were generated and genome-wide profiles were obtained by hybridization to Affymetrix arrays. A comparison was made among all samples to discover the changes in gene expression during the periods of rod and cone photoreceptor death.

Results
MGCs respond to retinal degeneration by undergoing gliosis, a process marked by the upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap). Many additional transcripts were found to change. These can be placed into functional clusters, such as retinal remodeling, stress response, and immune-related response.

Conclusions
A high degree of heterogeneity among the individual cells was observed, possibly due to their different spatial proximities to dying cells and/or inherent heterogeneity among MGCs.},

	abstract = {The development of complex tissues requires that mitotic progenitor cells integrate information from the environment. The highly varied outcomes of such integration processes undoubtedly depend at least in part upon variations among the gene expression programs of individual progenitor cells. To date, there has not been a comprehensive examination of these differences among progenitor cells of a particular tissue. Here, we used comprehensive gene expression profiling to define these differences among individual progenitor cells of the vertebrate retina. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) have been shown by lineage analysis to be multipotent throughout development and to produce distinct types of daughter cells in a temporal, conserved order. A total of 42 single RPCs were profiled on Affymetrix arrays. In situ hybridizations performed on both retinal sections and dissociated retinal cells were used to validate the results of the microarrays. An extensive amount of heterogeneity in gene expression among RPCs, even among cells isolated from the same developmental time point, was observed. While many classes of genes displayed heterogeneity of gene expression, the expression of transcription factors constituted a significant amount of the observed heterogeneity. In contrast to previous findings, individual RPCs were found to express multiple bHLH transcription factors, suggesting alternative models to those previously developed concerning how these factors may be coordinated. Additionally, the expression of cell cycle related transcripts showed differences among those associated with G2 and M, versus G1 and S phase, suggesting different levels of regulation for these genes. These data provide insights into the types of processes and genes that are fundamental to cell fate choices, proliferation decisions, and, for cells of the central nervous system, the underpinnings of the formation of complex circuitry.},

	abstract = {The discovery of cell type-specific markers can provide insight into cellular function and the origins of cellular heterogeneity. With a recent push for the improved understanding of neuronal diversity, it is important to identify genes whose expression defines various subpopulations of cells. The retina serves as an excellent model for the study of central nervous system diversity, as it is composed of multiple major cell types. The study of each major class of cells has yielded genetic markers that facilitate the identification of these populations. However, multiple subtypes of cells exist within each of these major retinal cell classes, and few of these subtypes have known genetic markers, although many have been characterized by morphology or function. A knowledge of genetic markers for individual retinal subtypes would allow for the study and mapping of brain targets related to specific visual functions and may also lend insight into the gene networks that maintain cellular diversity. Current avenues used to identify the genetic markers of subtypes possess drawbacks, such as the classification of cell types following sequencing. This presents a challenge for data analysis and requires rigorous validation methods to ensure that clusters contain cells of the same function. We propose a technique for identifying the morphology and functionality of a cell prior to isolation and sequencing, which will allow for the easier identification of subtype-specific markers. This technique may be extended to non-neuronal cell types, as well as to rare populations of cells with minor variations. This protocol yields excellent-quality data, as many of the libraries have provided read depths greater than 20 million reads for single cells. This methodology overcomes many of the hurdles presented by Single-cell RNA-Seq and may be suitable for researchers aiming to profile cell types in a straightforward and highly efficient manner.},

This approach revealed a set of transcripts that were not previously characterized in (Müller) glia; validation of the expression of some of these genes was performed by in situ hybridization.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the distribution patterns of P2Y receptors in distinct retinal cell types in the adult retina. Retinal ganglion cells (RGC), bipolar cells (BPC) and Muller cells (MC) of adult pigmented rats were analyzed for their expression of P2Y-receptor subtypes P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 by single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (SC-RT-PCR). SC-RT-PCR resulted in a positive amplification signal for all P2Y-receptor subtype mRNAs in all cell types examined. However, subtype distribution differed among the different cell types. The percentage of cells expressing a distinct P2Y subtype was: (a) for RGCs: 80\% with P2Y1, 100\% with P2Y2, 30\% with P2Y4 and 50\% with P2Y6, (b) for BPCs: 60\% with P2Y1, 40\% with P2Y2, 20\% with P2Y4 and 80\% with P2Y6, and (c) for MCs: 60\% with P2Y1, 80\% with P2Y2, 60\% with P2Y4 and 100\% with P2Y6. Our data show that different subtypes of P2Y receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6) are expressed in various retinal cells and indicate that extracellular purines and pyrimidines act on RGCs, BPCs and MCs via different P2Y receptors.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore the possible existence of inward rectifying currents in the distal dendrites of amacrine cells.
METHODS: Patch-clamp recordings were made from amacrine cells in a new horizontal slice preparation of mouse retina. Single-cell RT-PCR studies were performed after the patch-clamp recordings.
RESULTS: In contrast to results from vertical slices or dissociated cells, all amacrine cells tested demonstrated inward rectifying currents, IIR. Within the limits of our sample, this current did not depend on the morphological and physiological type of the amacrine cell. Amacrine cells from which the dendrites had been removed did not possess detectable amounts of IIR. Pharmacological experiments with ZD7288 (100 microM) and single-cell RT-PCR from recorded cells revealed that IIR includes an h-current (I(H)) carried by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels (HCN), HCN1 and/or HCN2 subtypes. In the presence of extracellular Cs+ (5 mM), which greatly suppressed IIR, the resting membrane conductance was reduced. IIR suppressed the generation of oscillatory potentials. Intracellular cAMP (8-cpt-cAMP, 1 mM) activated IIR.
CONCLUSIONS: IIR appears to occur within dendrites of many amacrine cells, where it tends to stabilize the resting membrane potential. HCN1 and/or HCN2 channels contribute to IIR in amacrine cells. Dendritic IIR would be expected to contribute to functional independence of the distal dendrites of amacrine cells that express it.},

	abstract = {In the retina, dopamine plays a central role in neural adaptation to light. Progress in the study of dopaminergic amacrine (DA) cells has been limited because they are very few (450 in each mouse retina, 0.005\% of retinal neurons). Here, we applied transgenic technology, single-cell global mRNA amplification, and cDNA microarray screening to identify transcripts present in DA cells. To profile gene expression in single neurons, we developed a method (SMART7) that combines a PCR-based initial step (switching mechanism at the 5' end of the RNA transcript or SMART) with T7 RNA polymerase amplification. Single-cell targets were synthesized from genetically labeled DA cells to screen the RIKEN 19k mouse cDNA microarrays. Seven hundred ninety-five transcripts were identified in DA cells at a high level of confidence, and expression of the most interesting genes was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Twenty-one previously undescribed proteins were found in DA cells, including a chloride channel, receptors and other membrane glycoproteins, kinases, transcription factors, and secreted neuroactive molecules. Thirty-eight percent of transcripts were ESTs or coding for hypothetical proteins, suggesting that a large portion of the DA cell proteome is still uncharacterized. Because cryptochrome-1 mRNA was found in DA cells, immunocytochemistry was extended to other components of the circadian clock machinery. This analysis showed that DA cells contain the most common clock-related proteins.},

	abstract = {Transgenic technology, immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology, intracellular injection techniques, and reverse transcription PCR were combined to study the expression of neuronal connexin36 (Cx36) in the outer plexiform layer of the mouse retina. Transgenic animals expressed either a fusion protein of full-length Cx36 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) attached at the C terminus or exon 2 of Cx36 was replaced bybeta-galactosidase (beta-gal). In the outer nuclear layer,beta-gal-positive cell bodies, which were confined to the most distal region close to the outer limiting membrane, displayed immunoreactivity against S-cone opsin. Cx36-EGFP puncta colocalized with cone pedicles, which were visualized by intracellular injection. In reverse transcriptase PCR experiments, Cx36 mRNA was never detected in samples of rods harvested from the outer nuclear layer. These results strongly suggest expression of Cx36 in cones but not in rods. In vertical sections, Cx36 expression in the vitreal part of the outer plexiform layer was characterized by a patchy distribution. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against the neurokinin-3 receptor and the potassium channel HCN4 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel) displayed clusters of the Cx36 label on the dendrites of OFF-cone bipolar cells. In horizontal sections, these clusters of Cx36 appeared as round or oval-shaped groups of individual puncta, and they were always aligned with the base of cone pedicles. Double-labeling experiments and single-cell reverse transcriptase PCR ruled out expression of Cx36 in horizontal cells and rod bipolar cells. At light microscopic resolution, we found close association of Cx36-EGFP with the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 but not with GluR2-GluR4, the kainate receptor subunit GluR5, or the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6.},

	abstract = {Usually, photoreceptors interact with other retinal cells through the neurotransmitter glutamate. Here we describe a nonsynaptic interaction via a secreted protein, retinoschisin. Using in situ hybridization, we found that from early postnatal life retinoschisin mRNA is present only in the outer retina of the mouse, and with single-cell RT-PCR we demonstrated its localization in rod and cone photoreceptor cells but not in Müller cells. Western blot analyses of proteins from cultured ocular tissues and microdissected outer and inner retinas, as well as from the culture media of these samples, showed that retinoschisin is secreted from the photoreceptor cells. Immunostaining of permeabilized and nonpermeabilized dissociated retinal cells revealed that retinoschisin is mainly inside and outside the photoreceptors, outside bipolar cells, and associated with plasma membranes of Müller cells and inside their distal processes. Because we showed previously that retinoschisin is distributed all over the retina, our current data suggest that after synthesis and secretion by the photoreceptors, retinoschisin reaches the surface of retinal cells and mediates interactions/adhesion between photoreceptor, bipolar, and Müller cells, contributing to the maintenance of the cytoarchitectural integrity of the retina. These interactions may not occur when the gene encoding retinoschisin is mutated, as it occurs in X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, a disease that results in morphological and electrophysiological defects of the retina.},

	abstract = {P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels activated by ATP. They are expressed in a broad variety of tissues. To date, eight P2X receptor subunits (P2X(1)-P2X(7), P2XM) have been cloned. In spite of the considerable evidence of signaling by extracellular nucleotides in other sensory systems, only few studies have been undertaken in the retina. In earlier studies, we have demonstrated that there is mRNA expression of the P2X(2-5) and P2X(7) subunits in the rat retina. In the present study, molecular biological methods were used to investigate expression of P2X receptor mRNA in freshly isolated Müller cells (MCs) of the adult rat retina (Brown Norway). A total of 36 MCs was analyzed, employing the single-cell RT-PCR. A positive amplification signal of 11/14 for P2X(3)-mRNA, 5/10 for P2X(4)-mRNA, 3/10 for P2X(5)-mRNA and 0/8 for P2X(7)-mRNA was revealed. Additionally, the astroglial identity of the cells under studied was confirmed in 10 cases by simultaneous amplification of RT-PCR products of glutamine synthetase (GS)- and P2X-mRNA. We conclude that MCs of rat retina express ionotropic P2 receptors, which, in addition to other functions, may play a key role within the recently described long range calcium signaling and the fast direct glia-neuron interactions in the rat retina.},

Discrepant SNPs across four contaminating genes validate the contamination. Low-level contamination affects {\textasciitilde}40\% of samples and leads to numerous eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 18 genes.

We also identified species-specific patterns of gene expression during human and mouse retinal development.

	abstract = {Most irreversible blindness results from retinal disease. To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of {\textasciitilde}85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90\% of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing.},

With aging, epithelial cells upregulate host-defense programs, and resident macrophages upregulate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling genes.

	abstract = {Purpose
Single cell (sc) analyses of key embryonic, fetal and adult stages were performed to generate a comprehensive single cell atlas of all the corneal and adjacent conjunctival cell types from development to adulthood.
Methods
Four human adult and seventeen embryonic and fetal corneas from 10 to 21 post conception week (PCW) specimens were dissociated to single cells and subjected to scRNA- and/or ATAC-Seq using the 10x Genomics platform. These were embedded using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Seurat graph-based clustering. Cluster identification was performed based on marker gene expression, bioinformatic data mining and immunofluorescence (IF) analysis. RNA interference, IF, colony forming efficiency and clonal assays were performed on cultured limbal epithelial cells (LECs).
Results
scRNA-Seq analysis of 21,343 cells from four adult human corneas and adjacent conjunctivas revealed the presence of 21 cell clusters, representing the progenitor and differentiated cells in all layers of cornea and conjunctiva as well as immune cells, melanocytes, fibroblasts, and blood/lymphatic vessels. A small cell cluster with high expression of limbal progenitor cell (LPC) markers was identified and shown via pseudotime analysis to give rise to five other cell types representing all the subtypes of differentiated limbal and corneal epithelial cells. A novel putative LPCs surface marker, GPHA2, expressed on the surface of 0.41\% ± 0.21 of the cultured LECs, was identified, based on predominant expression in the limbal crypts of adult and developing cornea and RNAi validation in cultured LECs. Combining scRNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses, we identified multiple upstream regulators for LPCs and demonstrated a close interaction between the immune cells and limbal progenitor cells. RNA-Seq analysis indicated the loss of GPHA2 expression and acquisition of proliferative limbal basal epithelial cell markers during ex vivo LEC expansion, independently of the culture method used. Extending the single cell analyses to keratoconus, we were able to reveal activation of collagenase in the corneal stroma and a reduced pool of limbal suprabasal cells as two key changes underlying the disease phenotype. Single cell RNA-Seq of 89,897 cells obtained from embryonic and fetal cornea indicated that during development, the conjunctival epithelium is the first to be specified from the ocular surface epithelium, followed by the corneal epithelium and the establishment of LPCs, which predate the formation of limbal niche by a few weeks.
Conclusions
Our scRNA-and ATAC-Seq data of developing and adult cornea in steady state and disease conditions provide a unique resource for defining genes/pathways that can lead to improvement in ex vivo LPCs expansion, stem cell differentiation methods and better understanding and treatment of ocular surface disorders.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies discrete cell-signatures based on transcriptomic identities. Six adult human corneas were processed for single-cell RNAseq and 16 cell clusters were bioinformatically identified. Based on their transcriptomic signatures and RNAscope results using representative cluster marker genes on human cornea cross-sections, these clusters were confirmed to be stromal keratocytes, endothelium, several subtypes of corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium, and supportive cells in the limbal stem cell niche. The complexity of the epithelial cell layer was captured by eight distinct corneal clusters and three conjunctival clusters. These were further characterized by enriched biological pathways and molecular characteristics which revealed novel groupings related to development, function, and location within the epithelial layer. Moreover, epithelial subtypes were found to reflect their initial generation in the limbal region, differentiation, and migration through to mature epithelial cells. The single-cell map of the human cornea deepens the knowledge of the cellular subsets of the cornea on a whole genome transcriptional level. This information can be applied to better understand normal corneal biology, serve as a reference to understand corneal disease pathology, and provide potential insights into therapeutic approaches.},

To assess morphology of molecularly defined types, we adapted a method for CRISPR-based integration of reporters into selectively expressed genes. For Müller glia, we found that transcriptionally distinct cells were regionally localized along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and central-peripheral retinal axes. We also identified immature photoreceptor, horizontal cell, and oligodendrocyte types that persist into late embryonic stages. Finally, we analyzed relationships among chick, mouse, and primate retinal cell classes and types. Our results provide a foundation for anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and developmental studies of the avian visual system.},

	abstract = {Amacrine cells (ACs) are a diverse class of interneurons that modulate input from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), rendering each RGC type selectively sensitive to particular visual features, which are then relayed to the brain. While many AC types have been identified morphologically and physiologically, they have not been comprehensively classified or molecularly characterized. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing to profile {\textgreater}32,000 ACs from mice of both sexes and applied computational methods to identify 63 AC types. We identified molecular markers for each type and used them to characterize the morphology of multiple types. We show that they include nearly all previously known AC types as well as many that had not been described. Consistent with previous studies, most of the AC types expressed markers for the canonical inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA or glycine, but several expressed neither or both. In addition, many expressed one or more neuropeptides, and two expressed glutamatergic markers. We also explored transcriptomic relationships among AC types and identified transcription factors expressed by individual or multiple closely related types. Noteworthy among these were Meis2 and Tcf4, expressed by most GABAergic and most glycinergic types, respectively. Together, these results provide a foundation for developmental and functional studies of ACs, as well as means for genetically accessing them. Along with previous molecular, physiological, and morphologic analyses, they establish the existence of at least 130 neuronal types and nearly 140 cell types in the mouse retina.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mouse retina is a leading model for analyzing the development, structure, function, and pathology of neural circuits. A complete molecular atlas of retinal cell types provides an important foundation for these studies. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the most heterogeneous class of retinal interneurons, amacrine cells, identifying 63 distinct types. The atlas includes types identified previously as well as many novel types. We provide evidence for the use of multiple neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and identify transcription factors expressed by groups of closely related types. Combining these results with those obtained previously, we proposed that the mouse retina contains ∼130 neuronal types and is therefore comparable in complexity to other regions of the brain.},

	abstract = {Neuronal types in the central nervous system differ dramatically in their resilience to injury or other insults. Here we studied the selective resilience of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC), which severs their axons and leads to death of ∼80\% of RGCs within 2 weeks. To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 46 RGC types in adult retina. We then tracked their survival after ONC; characterized transcriptomic, physiological, and morphological changes that preceded degeneration; and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, using loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo, we showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury and demonstrates that differential gene expression can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention.},

	abstract = {It is now possible to describe—imperfectly, but in more than outline—the types of neurons by which the retina carries out its computations. This is the rough draft of a “neurome,” a conscious effort to list all the tissue's neurons. Identifying the cell populations has led directly to a revised conception of the retina's input–output functions and of the fundamental elements from which visual perception is built.The retina is the first substantially complex structure of the central nervous system for which such a more or less complete parts list is available (Fig. 1). The resulting picture, the work of a community of investigators worldwide, resulted in a paradigm shift. A retina once imagined as based around a 6- to 12-cell module was replaced by a retina of multiple parallel arrays, containing at least 60 functionally different cell types and decomposing the visual input into more than a dozen different representations. The multiplex structure raises fundamental questions about the events that must occur later, in the central visual system.},
